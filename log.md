# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Done with a Responsive Web Design Project which was to build a Tribute Page. As I knew a lot about 'Che's' history it seemed fair to me that I should write the tribute page of him.

**Thoughts:** Took a hellava lot time than it should've. I'll try better tomorrow
